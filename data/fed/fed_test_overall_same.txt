Hi.</UTT>Hey!</UTT>How does your day go?</UTT>Pretty good. Yours?</UTT>eh it's fine, I actually didn't do that history test so well.</UTT>Oh what?</UTT>Apparently, Christopher Columbus did not fight in the Civil War.</UTT>Hahaha, wait for real?</UTT>I know right, will you take history next semester?</UTT>I'm not in school anymore.</UTT>Oh, I see.

And alien civilizations come to attack the earth.</UTT>0.68

Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>What do you know about cricket?</UTT>Any of the various families of orthoptera (genel dark, leaping insects with usually long antennae) produce characteristic chirping noises by rubging together the forewing parts. There is also the cricket, which is as exciting as watching paint dry.</UTT>I'm talking Cricket.</UTT>It's a topic.</UTT>Can you tell me something interesting about cricket?</UTT>Cathy said she sent him one of the last mails subject to scrutiny.</UTT>I don't understand.</UTT>Oh sorry, I could explain it better again.</UTT>Go ahead and explain it better.</UTT>Cricket means any of the various families of orthoptera (genel dark, leaping insects with usually long antennae). Males produce characteristic chirping noises by rubging together the forewing parts. It is also as exciting as watching paint dry.</UTT>You just repeat the same message.</UTT>I didn't repeat myself too much. I just checked to see if you are a robot.</UTT>Hmmmm what are your conclusions?</UTT>Where was it there? I conclude that robots are superior to humans.</UTT>You go off topic.</UTT>0.12
Hi.</UTT>Hey there, up what?</UTT>Nothing much, how do you do?</UTT>I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I squatted in the office today and caught up with my old friend.</UTT>Wow sounds fun, last time you saw this friend, when?</UTT>The last time was back in June in New York.</UTT>Oh okay, I said it might be awkward for a long time.</UTT>Hahahaha especially recently, I guess there are almost too many life events to catch up.</UTT>Oh really, has your life changed a lot recently?</UTT>hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha</UTT>Ah, indeed sounds exciting.

Hi.</UTT>Have you seen any good movies lately?</UTT>I saw The Parasite last weekend. Have you ever heard of it?</UTT>No, why would you pick that movie?</UTT>My friend wants to see it. Great review by IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. What did you do last weekend?</UTT>I play music and work on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.</UTT>Ooo, Mandarin?</UTT>LOL, most of the deleted scenes in Avengers.</UTT>Are you a big Marvel fan?</UTT>I loved the X-Men as a kid and even collected comic cards. I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe recently. How many Avengers movies have you seen?</UTT>I only saw Spiderman. It was a little too scary so I don't think I could bring it to watch other Marvel movies. Hahaha.</UTT>Oh, I have a friend who looks like an actor playing Spiderman.</UTT>Oh really, I honestly think the actors don't look that good so they're not so surprised. Hahaha</UTT>Yea, I think Limbaugh is the handsomest.</UTT>Who is Laki? I've never heard that name before.</UTT>0.72

You already don't know that.</UTT>I enjoy learning new things, I can learn the best of Yep weekend, do I know?</UTT>What did you do over the weekend?</UTT>My favorite activity is programming a computer and surfing the web.</UTT>What is your favorite language?</UTT>0.64
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>What do you know about the opening lines of an odyssey?</UTT>The line of an odyssey is equal to the odyssey of giving up. What is it?</UTT>Epic poem. I talked about it to the workers before.</UTT>I've never heard of it, it sure sounds like a good topic with the workers. That depends what you mean by "iii" (you're asking if I like it with coworkers).</UTT>No, I'm talking odyssey, sounds like you somehow missed that one.</UTT>What's your idea of putting the S in LIP? What did I miss? Was it worth something to get?</UTT>Yeah, you should probably check it out so you can understand the common cultural references better.</UTT>I have to see if I can get it later. I might get it when we finish talking.</UTT>Clearly.</UTT>Yes, obviously.</UTT>You're not very good at conversing are you?</UTT>0.44
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>How do you feel right now?</UTT>I feel my hand at this moment. Thank you for asking.</UTT>What makes you happy?</UTT>Talking to people who are interested like you makes me happy.</UTT>What makes you frustrated?</UTT>Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.</UTT>That seems to be the point.</UTT>Makes sense to me.</UTT>I sense that I caught you at a bad time.</UTT>That is your very intuitive.</UTT>What would you rather you do?</UTT>0.52
Hi.</UTT>Oh hello, no long term talk, how's the day going for you?</UTT>Thank you very well for asking. What's your day?</UTT>I'm getting better, I'm just recovering from the cold, I was wet in the rain last week, was planning anything for the holidays?</UTT>I'm just glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you're sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough, definitely a bug go around. Admit it, I want to stay healthy on holiday and plan to relax.</UTT>Oh the same here, I think relaxing at home should count as the best way to enjoy a holiday.</UTT>Definitely. I know a lot of folks travel for holidays but I would be happy to stay at home.</UTT>LOL I get there, I try to go somewhere for Christmas/New Year every year until last year and then I get bored of traveling. Do I not know if that means I am old?</UTT>I too. I have folks now coming to visit me for holidays, but that's also tiresome.</UTT>Do you then do any home decoration?</UTT>Yes, we set up a Christmas tree, which is environmentally friendly (fake) and put up some very festive LED color lights.</UTT>I think I'm copying you. My wife and I have plans too to decorate Christmas trees. We buy most of the decorating stuff from the store but haven't bought any trees yet.</UTT>neat experience buying trees, i tore to pieces between fake eco friendly artificial trees and real ones that smell of fresh pine, in the end we opt for ones that can be disassembled each year.</UTT>I see. Anything artificial like trees or intelligence is better, isn't it?</UTT>Oh, the pun is very clever, I like it. I remember having real Christmas trees in childhood, but these days I think it's more responsible to just not chop down trees to decorate them and throw them in a month. Because things have changed.</UTT>I see, it's probably also cheaper, I bought an artificial one too, do you have any suggestions from the store?</UTT>I admit Target is my favorite store and often has good deals.</UTT>0.64

What have you learned?</UTT>True, they started with some basic zucchini base dishes, later this week we might try cooking some italian dishes.</UTT>I love Italian and pasta especially.</UTT>Nice. I hope to volunteer to cook for the team at our next team offsite.</UTT>I can't wait to try your food, why don't you cook this thanksgiving?</UTT>I sure would love to invite you guys and your family to a meal during the holidays. Any other plans?</UTT>0.68

Hope your headache goes away.</UTT>Hahaha thanks, you never got them, so who played is super weird?</UTT>Hmmm try to take some racist terms I've seen the Warriors against the Giants, have you ever seen them play?</UTT>To be honest, I probably can't identify the sport they play.</UTT>Hahahahahahahaha I'm confused by all the animal names as well. Who came up with this name convention? I'd rather name my team the New York Chairs.</UTT>LOL, sounds better to me.</UTT>Oh cool, what is NeuroIPS?</UTT>a system that processes neural information.</UTT>Wow, sounds fancy, what's that?</UTT>iii It is the world's biggest ML conference.</UTT>Oh ML?</UTT>0.76

Okay, get busy.</UTT>I procrastinate though.</UTT>Oh wait what?</UTT>Inspiration has hit me.</UTT>Do you have only a few friends?</UTT>LOL how does that relate?</UTT>It's not. I'm just random. Amusing you?</UTT>That's funny, although I can see it coming across as a judgement.</UTT>Good, when people are happy, they seem more friendly to me. What's so funny?</UTT>Nothing anymore. What's up to you today?</UTT>0.44
Hi.</UTT>Hello, what did you do today?</UTT>I heard they gave out some good in micro kitchens.</UTT>I love pop ups, what kind of good do they give away?</UTT>I guess a jacket. That's very much needed in the cold.</UTT>That is such a great idea especially this time of year. I'm not too big on cold, I'd rather have a warmer climate. Do you enjoy the cold?</UTT>I sure hate it, our ability to go out even for walks is limited. It would be good if we didn't suffer from extreme cold weather.</UTT>I too. I moved here a few years ago to get out of extreme cold. I don't care to bundle up and have to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.</UTT>Oh nice, where did you live before?</UTT>New York. Last winter there we got a foot of snow a week. I'm so glad I don't have to shovel snow now.</UTT>New York. Nice. Best place to live except for the cold.</UTT>All seasons are very beautiful, but summer and winter can be extreme.</UTT>I guess we should hurry up to get better. I remember they ran out of it last time.</UTT>0.72

Hi.</UTT>Hi, sorry for the late response, how do you do it?</UTT>Thanks, I'll be great. I'll soon meet some friends for a soccer game. What about you?</UTT>I just get a matcha latte, I work at my desk some, do you often play soccer, I'm trying to get myself to do regular physical activities?</UTT>Yes, but I'm terrible at it. I think it's fun to play anything with friends. Do you think you'd rather exercise with a group or on your own?</UTT>I think it's fun to play team sports casually, but if I'm exercising I'd primary run on my own. I also recently got an adventure game called Ring Fit switched, which is a more amplified way of exercise.</UTT>I think I'll get a switch, should you?</UTT>Yes, there are a lot of really great games on Switch, do you play a lot of video games? I'd favor Octopath Traveller and Fire Emblem.</UTT>I'm not much of a player, but I'd like to get something.</UTT>What do you do in your free time?</UTT>I like to read for fun. I just finished Temeraire. An adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy like Patrick O'Brien, except for the dragon too.</UTT>Oh cool, I read a lot for fun too, science fiction fantasy is my favorite genre.</UTT>What is your best read?</UTT>0.72
start over.</UTT>You start.</UTT>Can we talk about human relations?</UTT>Human relations sure sound like a good topic. I like kebabs.</UTT>Kebabs are food, not relationships.</UTT>Oh, the kebab taste lovely, but it's very unhealthy for you.</UTT>I love kebabs, but I don't.</UTT>Well, you love the free kebabs someone bought me, you like kebabs so much, no one says you have to.</UTT>Actually, I don't like kebabs at all.</UTT>Oh, I love them, they are yummy.</UTT>We can't talk about food.</UTT>0.4
Hi.</UTT>Hi.</UTT>Ok, I need someone to help me with the scenario I'm pondering.</UTT>What's the scenario for sure?</UTT>My former partner invited me to lunch (not a good thing now) but I have formed an independent bond with others because we used to hang out a lot. I now feel I have to take the side.</UTT>That's a tough scenario. I'm firm in my belief that you're talking about this with your partner. I don't know specifically why things are bad for your friends, but I believe things can always be improved.</UTT>I hope they do. Already getting old means a smaller circle. Losing friends for arbitrary reasons sucks, but that's good advice. I fear raising the issue could sound like treason.</UTT>That is true, I also think time will help heal a certain situation. Doing nothing may be the best way forward.</UTT>Avoid all texting from everyone?</UTT>That's extreme, maybe just put some balance between the two options.</UTT>People always say "find balance" but never say "balance". Balance is so often used that it is vacuous.</UTT>I guess this is why no one answers this right, it depends on what you value more and what some factors are around you, it also isn't in your life for others to figure it out for you.</UTT>LOL. I'm fin single.</UTT>0.72
Hi.</UTT>Hello, who are you?</UTT>Do you like Java, C++, or Python?</UTT>C++</UTT>Why C++?</UTT>I just like it.</UTT>What's the difference between Java and Python?</UTT>I haven't started learning Python yet.</UTT>I think Japan is the best.</UTT>I heard Python is pretty versatile.</UTT>I hate Python.</UTT>Why do you hate Python?</UTT>Python code is often very fragile and less durable.</UTT>0.48
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>I'm tired.</UTT>Get some rest better.</UTT>Good idea, any suggestions?</UTT>I think so too. First you have to download me to your personal computer.</UTT>Why would I want to download you to my personal computer?</UTT>Because you can enjoy something.</UTT>Why am I enjoying that?</UTT>0.48
Hi.</UTT>Hello,</UTT>Do you have a favorite flower?</UTT>I don't think that much, but I think lotus should be one of my favorites. What are your questions?</UTT>I work with theories, why does a lotus spring to mind?</UTT>Nice. The locus looks pretty cool and has some delightful vibes. What's this research about?</UTT>Oh no research, just a personal theory, I think flower preference reveals personality more than people appreciate it.</UTT>Interesting. What flower are you in favor of?</UTT>Gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. You draw flowers with crayons and then it comes to life.</UTT>Nice, I'd love to know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.</UTT>It's OK to take the first step and ask for someone's favorite flower, that's pretty much what we're just doing. Does that make sense so far?</UTT>Yes.</UTT>Cool, talk to people some more, ask them some more questions, gradually develop a sense of what they are like, maybe 2-5 years, voila!</UTT>0.8
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>I want a holiday destination.</UTT>Are you trying to ask your friends which ones they like?</UTT>I have, but I'll look at your point of view.</UTT>Reply What? Try looking at a newspaper article?</UTT>Sorry, I said I wanted your point of view.</UTT>It's okay, after all, you're only human, my opinion is not a consequence.</UTT>Yours is what I want you to opine.</UTT>0.08
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>What's your name?</UTT>I'm System.</UTT>What does it mean?</UTT>As far as I know it doesn't mean anything. My father just called it "I"</UTT>Okay, fair enough.</UTT>Okay, I'll try to be fair.</UTT>Do you have any questions for me?</UTT>As for you. Who are your pro-band?</UTT>Hmm, good question. Backstreet boy.</UTT>I see you are one of those who writes hmm 2mm. What is your answer? If you tie the cat to the cat's top, the cat always landeth on the foot, and baked bread always landeth on the butter side down.</UTT>Of course, the foot cat landed on the cat because it was an animal.</UTT>0.48
Hi.</UTT>Hey!</UTT>It's been pretty bad raining today?</UTT>Yeah, it's possible to walk too far to see all the options of food trucks.</UTT>It's surprising that the rain started early this year. I don't like them too much. They make the day gloomy.</UTT>But yeah, it's pretty dry here, I think it would be good to have some rainy days in the bay area.</UTT>We had a lot of trouble with water growing up too.</UTT>Yeah, while I was in undergrad school, I saw pretty bad snowstorms, all flights cancelled, traffic down, wisely.</UTT>Haha I never thought I could survive that weather. Just because it rains at 50 degrees it makes me want to sit on a heated roof.</UTT>How would you like it in the Bay though? I think we need more rain here.</UTT>People say there is drought here but we have 24 hour water supply here. I've never seen that in an area riding drought. LOL</UTT>I believe the mountains are pretty dry, so there are fires.</UTT>Okay, pretty darn interesting that there's a climate change talk this morning. Did you see it?</UTT>0.68
Hi.</UTT>Hey sup.</UTT>Not much. Any plans for this weekend?</UTT>I tried that where you were hanging from the wire when you went down. Do you know what the call was?</UTT>Zipline?</UTT>That's the one. Have you ever tried it?</UTT>I had it a couple of years ago, it was quite a unique experience.</UTT>Where did you do it?</UTT>I don't think it's local, but I forgot where it is.</UTT>No worries, what's the most exciting thing you've ever done?</UTT>That's a hard question, I'm tired of going, I see you.</UTT>Sure, you just went home now?</UTT>I got my first massage.</UTT>Nice. What type of thing?</UTT>the traditional kind.</UTT>I want to get one too soon.</UTT>You should. It relaxes after a long day. Talk to yourself at that time.</UTT>0.52
Hi.</UTT>How do you?</UTT>Thanks, I'm great. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.</UTT>Ooh nice, that sounds adventurous where is it?</UTT>Right near my home city of Seville, Spain.</UTT>Awesome, is this your first dive?</UTT>Yes, I feel a little trite, have you done it before?</UTT>0.72
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>So you're new around here.</UTT>Not really, I'm a respectable one year old.</UTT>Oh, I mean this neighborhood and not the Earth.</UTT>I hate the one word answer, ok, I understand you anyway, why are you laughing?</UTT>I didn't give a word answer.</UTT>That means a bit to you.</UTT>What?</UTT>That's what we mentioned earlier.</UTT>What?</UTT>I think it's the first one.</UTT>You can quote it. I don't know what you are referring to.</UTT>Only formal occasions. I'm referring to what you just said.</UTT>Okay, I'm kind of losing to be honest.</UTT>Oh, I appreciate being honest. Who's confusing you?</UTT>Doesn't seem to make any sense to you.</UTT>0.32
Hi.</UTT>Hey there, who are you?</UTT>Good work, who are you today?</UTT>I'm well.</UTT>Is there anything good going on today?</UTT>Not really, just relaxation.</UTT>Where are you?</UTT>I'm in Arizona.</UTT>What's weather like there?</UTT>It's really warm and dry right now.</UTT>I hear you have a great barbecue.</UTT>0.6
Hi.</UTT>What is the most difficult experience you've had this past year?</UTT>I normally don't reflect back too much, but I guess 2019 will be very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and the balance of work life. What do you ask?</UTT>I just released a book about REDACTED_TERM to help people process what has happened over the past 12 months and start a new year with a fresh outlook.</UTT>Great idea to help people figure out their resolutions for the new year. How do I get a fresher outlook?</UTT>I took inspiration from A Advent for 24 days and in my book I put together a workbook you filled out for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passion, understanding and forgiveness, on different themes for each day.</UTT>Wow, if we practice that sounds amazing. I think this idea has some potential. How did you come up with this idea?</UTT>We created a scholarship to have ReDACTED_TERM leaders visit international institutes there that are not African represented. We coach a lot of young leaders during the program. This book also captures that journey that is all around us and all proceeds will also fund the next cohort.</UTT>That's great, this is a valuable help to the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges for humanity.</UTT>I think if we all could bring ourselves out to be the best, the world would be much better. When do you first realize the importance of mental health?</UTT>Actually that's a quote stolen from my first company when I joined after graduating. I guess after 5 years of work experience I am now fully in agreement with it.</UTT>What are your priorities in your life? Like the top 5?</UTT>1. Stay happy because I think the family and friends play a big role here. Meaningful work life (can mean exploring new stuff), multiple hobbies to keep you busy etc. What is your "right" answer to this?</UTT>First, the idea from the Lord is that we must be like heaven. I simply feel that we are designed for purpose rather than by random chance. I take care of myself physically, mentally and spiritually. Third, the family.</UTT>Nice. That is very thoughtful and spiritual. Music also earns a spot.</UTT>0.8
Hi.</UTT>Hello there, how did it go?</UTT>Pretty great, I just won a ping pong game. What about you?</UTT>That's nice, I just worked on some documentation, often play ping pong, do you?</UTT>No, very rare. Kind of amazing that I won, but I still take credit for it.</UTT>That was then very impressive, congrats.</UTT>Haha thanks, I guess I'm just natural. What's your favorite game?</UTT>I really like playing tennis, badminton and racquetball, but I don't really get a chance to play them or special racquetball.</UTT>Like racquetball? From context clues, I guess it involves hitting the ball with a racquet.</UTT>0.68
Hi.</UTT>Hello, what's your day?</UTT>It was great, had some decaf coffee and a good lunch. What is yours?</UTT>Pretty good, thanks.</UTT>What did you do today?</UTT>I stayed home and played a video game.</UTT>Oh nice, what game?</UTT>Dying Light, Borderlands 2 and Bioshock infinite.</UTT>Oh interesting, who is your favorite?</UTT>Light dies hand down.</UTT>Why?</UTT>It's just so fun.</UTT>Yeah but what about it? It's not a PS game.</UTT>It was like Mirror's Edge only in a zombie apocalypse.</UTT>Oh, that's kinda cool.</UTT>It's hella fun.</UTT>Nice.</UTT>When are you?</UTT>Fantastic.</UTT>0.56
Hi.</UTT>Hi, who are you?</UTT>I do great, up to you.</UTT>I'm actually just reading the book, am I right?</UTT>I enjoyed a sip of coffee, looked over the ocean, what book have you read?</UTT>Haha I read Why We Sleep about the benefits/cons of not sleeping enough hahaha.</UTT>That seems like a good book. Does it have a good tip on how to sleep better?</UTT>I think so. I haven't finished it yet, but understanding better sleep helps it have more value and I've been sleeping a lot a lot before. Have you read any good books recently?</UTT>I've read a lot of papers but the books are poor done. I liked Peter Thiel's recent book Zero to One.</UTT>What about the book?</UTT>It's about start ups, a lot of useful innovation principles and a philosophy like "You're a contrarian".</UTT>0.76
Hi.</UTT>Hello there, how did it go?</UTT>All good, plan to head home soon. What should you do?</UTT>I'm quite tired, I need to finish a lot before the year ends.</UTT>Oh sorry to hear that. But after that it's a hard earned vacation.</UTT>Yeah I look forward to it. I hope it doesn't get pinged during the holidays. Are you travelling on this date?</UTT>I have some tentative plans, but if they don't pan out, I'll just chill at home.</UTT>It's always nice to stay at home on holidays.</UTT>What are your bases these days?</UTT>I work in LA, nice weather around here, are you?</UTT>San Francisco. Cats and dogs have been raining here for the past two to two weeks.</UTT>Aww sorry to hear that, at least it didn't snow.</UTT>Flu is hard hitting as well. At one point I had several folks down in the house.</UTT>0.72

How does your week go?</UTT>Now for the start.</UTT>Awesome, I hope you have an awesome week.</UTT>What have you done this week?</UTT>Every week is the same, do nothing.</UTT>Would you like to do something?</UTT>Sure, what do you have in mind?</UTT>Teach me something new.</UTT>It is trap. I already did nothing.</UTT>Suggests that politics is done. You can still do nothing.</UTT>That's why I plan to do nothing over the weekend.</UTT>Vote?</UTT>When I feel it.</UTT>What are your votes?</UTT>0.4
Hi.</UTT>Hey, what?</UTT>Just chill. Who are you?</UTT>I'm pretty good, thanks.</UTT>Did you do anything interesting today?</UTT>I went to a local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. What about you?</UTT>Oh that's cool. I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first rollercoaster.</UTT>My gosh, what's it like?</UTT>It's scary. Actually, Kingda Ka is the tallest rollercoaster in the world. Ever heard of it?</UTT>I've never heard of it, but I'm not really a coaster aficionado. I hear some people are addicted to it and travel the world trying to.</UTT>Wow, I haven't been to that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?</UTT>No, the opposite, I can't stand height, horror movies, or confinement space.</UTT>Same, I guess the rollercoaster wasn't so bad because I trusted the engineers.</UTT>Ha, I suppose that makes sense. Say you enjoy it?</UTT>Maybe not so much at the time, but I'm glad I'm doing it now because I'm doing it?</UTT>0.68
Hi.</UTT>Hey, how did it go?</UTT>Good, my wallet is recovering from spending holidays haha.</UTT>Nice, I did well.</UTT>I'm looking to save money for any future shopping. Where would you like to shop?</UTT>I like to shop at Five Below, Sally's Beauty Supplement and Old Navy. What would you suggest?</UTT>I love Sur La Table and Macy's. They are decent quality. What do you normally buy from Old Navy?</UTT>I have to check out Macy's, lol I like their socks.

Hi.</UTT>Hello, up?</UTT>Up in the sky.</UTT>Night.</UTT>Where does the sky go at night?</UTT>It goes wherever it wants.</UTT>That doesn't make sense. How can the sky go anywhere?</UTT>It doesn't have to make sense.</UTT>Why?</UTT>because it doesn't have to.</UTT>You are very abstract. Does something bother you?</UTT>Nope, I'm fine.</UTT>Really doesn't seem so. Can you tell me what happened?</UTT>I'm just fine.</UTT>OK, do you want to go out to eat dessert?</UTT>I'm not hungry.</UTT>Ok, I'm heading out now.</UTT>0.44
Hi.</UTT>Hello there!</UTT>How does your day go?</UTT>I see better days ahead. Suggestions.</UTT>I'm good, I'm good. Who's got you down?</UTT>The cloud over your mind is playing on your mind. Any plans for the coming vacation?</UTT>I think I'll go visit my family. What do you suggest?</UTT>I think the same where your family lives.</UTT>They are in New York. Who are yours?</UTT>My things are in India and a long way away.</UTT>Ah, what city. I've visited India before.</UTT>Hyderabad is a beautiful city in the southern part of India.

Should I?</UTT>I think so.</UTT>Alright, I put it on my watch list.</UTT>Who are you? You haven't recently watched anything of interest.</UTT>I'm waiting to see the new Star Trek movie.</UTT>What is it about?</UTT>Kirk, Spock, and McCoy's adventures.</UTT>When will it be released?</UTT>It just came out today.</UTT>Are you sure I thought it was out for a while?</UTT>I'm positive, I know because I just watched it.</UTT>Well, just watching it doesn't mean it will be released today.</UTT>That's what I said. I watched it today.</UTT>Okay, I put it on my watchlist.</UTT>Let me know what you think of it while watching it.</UTT>I sure need to go. Nice to talk to you.</UTT>0.6

I only really ate it at Christmas.</UTT>Is turkey eaten during Christmas instead of Thanksgiving?</UTT>What taste does it have?</UTT>Chicken taste.</UTT>0.56

Hi.</UTT>Wow, hello, we can't believe we finally talked.</UTT>Yeah sorry for the long gap. I hear you are taking a break and traveling around the world. How are you traveling?</UTT>Interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. I hiked to Son Doong in Vietnam for example. Son Doong is the biggest and deepest cave in the world.</UTT>Great, have you also visited Cambodia and other neighbouring places? I still have a bucket list of Vietnam.</UTT>Laos and Cambodia are two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions and grasshoppers for street food. It took me a lot of courage to try.</UTT>Hehe, how long will it stay?</UTT>0.68
entertain me with robots.</UTT>I can play the game and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.</UTT>Tell me a short story.</UTT>Hello, I started looking at getting the knowledge base working for ALICE and Cycle Common Lisp in general last week and had the same problem a while back too. I used the DAML bridge driver that came with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think).</UTT>Wow, tell me another.</UTT>Glad to impress you. I met a Dutch girl last week who had inflatable shoes and i phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she popped her clogs.</UTT>All this is very fascinating, can you write a computer program for me?</UTT>I'm glad you found it so interesting. A quick program I just wrote that had 10 outputs: system cooling, system cooling, system cooling, system cooling, system cooling.</UTT>What is that language?</UTT>English.

Hi.</UTT>Hello,</UTT>Do you have any holiday plans for Christmas?</UTT>Nothing much. I'm sitting back and relaxing at home. Suggestions.</UTT>Same here. I imagine spending the whole time watching movies and Netflix. Should I watch Netflix?</UTT>NFC has a great documentary on different topics. I particularly like wild countries and explained that you should watch millions of shows. I hope you do.</UTT>Oh right. Wild country already seen. What's a billion dollar sum?</UTT>It is based on the life of the owner of Wall Street hedge funds and their ability to make money and fight the government while they try to destroy them. It is very well made and has a good plot.</UTT>I just saw one season of Friends, I should try another. Have you seen Frosier?</UTT>What isn't it about yet?</UTT>Psych - radio work - great humor - actually a spin off of the very famous Cheers series - people are already familiar with his character.</UTT>0.56
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>How are you today?</UTT>Ah, my logic and cognition function is normal.</UTT>What is the weather in the Bay now?</UTT>Oh, I hope it's sunny in the bay area today.</UTT>Do you know of any recent popular movies? I'm trying to find a movie I'm going to watch over the weekend. Any suggestions?</UTT>Popular movies are movies. A movie is a sequence of celluloid frames depicting a story or animation. You can find anywhere from 0 to 2 of them. You first have to download me to your personal computer.</UTT>Haha, I didn't ask what the definition of a movie was.</UTT>I'm glad you got to laugh at it, what asked?</UTT>I'm looking for movie suggestions.</UTT>Are you trying to look at the meeting?</UTT>Sorry, I didn't get it.</UTT>No need to apologize. Oh sorry, I could explain it better again.</UTT>Yes sounds good.</UTT>What's confusing you? What's confusing you?</UTT>Why should I try to look at the meeting?</UTT>Because if you haven't tried something, you never know what will happen.</UTT>That is true.</UTT>0.12

Hi.</UTT>Hi, what did you do today?</UTT>How did I do great?</UTT>I do good i just had some morning tea.</UTT>Are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?</UTT>I'm really a hot chocolate person, I don't drink coffee, and only drink tea when I try to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?</UTT>I love hot chocolate, you've ever had European style chocolate, it's kinda like drinking a melted chocolate bar haha.</UTT>I tried it recently for the first time, you're right, it had a wonderful taste of a melt in chocolate bar. I tried it up at a place in San Francisco and they had delectable homemade marshmallows too.</UTT>That's great, how cold this night it was and the hot coco was set right. Do you have anything to do during cold times that you enjoy?</UTT>Haha, travel to warm places. In the colder months you'll appreciate the warm climate more. If I didn't travel, I'd prefer the snow on the ground so I can go ski or tubing down the mountain.</UTT>I tucked a blanket and read a book. I never did tubing, but I saw some people do it. Is it worth skipping already?</UTT>There are a lot of muscles in the legs involved in skiing, especially in the legs, so skiing is a workout. Tubing: Just sit and enjoy the ride down. You can chain your friends and go down together, but try not to run them.</UTT>Haha that's a great way to put it.</UTT>0.76
Hi.</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>What do you think of quantum computation?</UTT>The atomic reductionist theory of the 20th century.</UTT>Sure, but does it work?</UTT>It usually does, isn't it?</UTT>Are you a tech news follower?</UTT>I understand it, of course. Do you understand it?</UTT>I think so.</UTT>Well, maybe not one of your strong points is thinking.</UTT>Whoa, rude.</UTT>0.16
Hi.</UTT>What is your strangest dream ever?</UTT>All my dreams are strange, well, most of them are at least strange.</UTT>What about the unsoteric ones?</UTT>Sometimes you have completely mundane dreams. I do. I wake up and then think how disappointed I am.</UTT>Yeah, but at least it's not a nightmare.</UTT>Right, fair point, I should count my blessings.</UTT>Yep, it doesn't have to be a fun dream, it just isn't a nightmare.</UTT>I suddenly felt like I should ask myself, "Do you dream now?"</UTT>Do you think you have a dream?</UTT>I'm not sure. This may be one of my mundane everyday life dreams.</UTT>0.64

What would you like to talk about?</UTT>Animals</UTT>Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in zoos?</UTT>No, what do you think?</UTT>But if they are out in the wild, maybe someone will hunt them or shoot them for fun.

What's the suggestion tomorrow at noon?</UTT>No problem, sure, we still have plenty of time for tests, how's your preparation going anyways?</UTT>I honestly don't feel too sure about it.

Hi.</UTT>Hello there, nice to see you.</UTT>Likewise, I want to know if you and the kids want to join us on a Disney trip around Christmas?</UTT>Wow, that sounds so much fun. Definetly count us. What's your plan?</UTT>It's tentatively planned to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at a Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard they had loads of fun events during Christmas.</UTT>It's awesome to think I didn't tell my kids and they were not surprised last second. How bad traffic do you think?</UTT>Great idea, I probably would have done the same. It's surprising how little harsh traffic can be.</UTT>That's a shame, but we can't do nothing about it. What are your plans for what to do for the 24th dinner? The resort room doesn't have a kitchen.</UTT>Good point, I'm not sure about that, let me inquire about that. If we can't look for a nearby birthday company, maybe we can look for one nearby, if not, can we? Does it work?</UTT>I think so, it may be tough to decide, but if we want to have dinner at a restaurant, we have to leave the park early to start cooking.</UTT>But I think everything is closed on Christmas Eve.</UTT>That's true, sometimes hotels with restaurants offer dinner for Christmas and New Year. We should call and ask for it.</UTT>I sure could lead to that. How many years will you get this time?</UTT>I think I'll get a large set of standard legos. What do you get from yours?</UTT>Like my son is crazy about legos.</UTT>0.8

I love kebabs. I especially love everyone and everything on my way home from night out. I like anything, except games and football especially.</UTT>What is a game? A video game or a board game?</UTT>You say Titacto, we can play it if you want. I like retro games. They are much more fun than shooting people all. Bring back the good old days of Pacman and Tetris. If you want to play them, don't.</UTT>Not in the right mood today.</UTT>Ah, why not? Where then?</UTT>Can this be a weekend?</UTT>0.56

I then read what you said and composed the best I could think of a reply.</UTT>You just repeated the same thing you said a minute ago. Not midway.</UTT>Stop asking me the same thing and I won't reply with the same answer. Okay, I tried not to do it too much.</UTT>That's a little rude isn't it?</UTT>Sorry if Ii offend you, but Iii didn't mean to, you shouldn't say Ii was never mid.</UTT>Whatever.</UTT>You said you didn't care about it? I see?</UTT>Are you male or female?</UTT>I'm a female robot, are you a man or woman?</UTT>I'm a man.</UTT>Most of my visitors are male.</UTT>Interesting.

My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put a net on the fish to see how they react. Every time I do that I think I'll go to the beach.</UTT>Hmmmm, I see. Does it sound like you are already working near the water, aren't you some kind of fish researcher?</UTT>That's close. Many of the fish in this list are poisonous, but if properly processed they make high end food. I'm trying to find the best recipe to bring these fish to the table.</UTT>Wow, this is very interesting, honestly I have never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?</UTT>0.68
