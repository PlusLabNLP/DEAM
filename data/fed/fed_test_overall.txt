Hi!</UTT>Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?</UTT>Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?</UTT>Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?</UTT>Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.</UTT>Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.</UTT>Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!</UTT>I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?</UTT>Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..</UTT>Are you doing any home decorating then?</UTT>Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.</UTT>I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.</UTT>Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.</UTT>I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?</UTT>Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.</UTT>I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?</UTT>Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.</UTT>0.64

I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.</UTT>What's the most recent good thing you read?</UTT>0.72
start over</UTT>You start.</UTT>Can we talk about human relationships ?</UTT>Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.</UTT>Kebab is food, not a relationship</UTT>. Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.</UTT>I love a kebab but I would not make love to it</UTT>Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.</UTT>I'm actually not into kebabs at all</UTT>Oh, I love them. They are yummy.</UTT>can we not talk about food</UTT>0.4
Hi!</UTT>Hi</UTT>Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.</UTT>Sure, whats the scenario?</UTT>My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.</UTT>That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.</UTT>I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.</UTT>True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.</UTT>AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?</UTT>Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.</UTT>People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.</UTT>Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)</UTT>Lol. I'm finna be single.</UTT>0.72
Hi!</UTT>Hello! :D How are you?</UTT>Do you like Java, C++ Or Python?</UTT>C++. :)</UTT>Why C++?</UTT>I just like it. :)</UTT>How about between Java and Python?</UTT>I haven't started learning Python yet.</UTT>I think Java is the best</UTT>I've heard Python is pretty versatile. :)</UTT>I hate Python</UTT>Why do you hate Python?</UTT>Code written in python is often very fragile and have less durability</UTT>0.48
Hi!</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>I'm tired.</UTT>Better get some rest.</UTT>Good idea. Any suggestions?</UTT>I thought so too. First you must download me to your personal computer.</UTT>Why would I want to download you to my personal computer?</UTT>Because it might be something you enjoy.</UTT>Why would I enjoy that?</UTT>0.48
Hi!</UTT>Hello</UTT>Do you have a favourite flower?</UTT>hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?</UTT>I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?</UTT>Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?</UTT>Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.</UTT>Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?</UTT>The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.</UTT>Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.</UTT>Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?</UTT>yes</UTT>Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila</UTT>0.8
Hi!</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>I want a recommendation for a holiday destination</UTT>Have you tried asking your friends which one they like?</UTT>I have, but I'm looking for your point of view</UTT>What was the reply? Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?</UTT>Sorry? I said I want your point of view</UTT>It's OK. After all, you are only human. My opinion is of no consequence.</UTT>Yours is the opinion I want</UTT>0.08
Hi</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>What is your name?</UTT>My name is System.</UTT>What does it mean?</UTT>It doesn't mean anything as far as I know. It's just what my father called me.</UTT>okay:) fair enough</UTT>Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.</UTT>Do you have any question for me?</UTT>For you? Who is your favourite band?</UTT>hmm good question. Backstreet boy</UTT>I see you are one of those people who writes "Hmm" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?</UTT>Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!</UTT>0.48
Hi!</UTT>hey</UTT>is it raining pretty bad today?</UTT>yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options</UTT>surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy</UTT>yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here :P</UTT>Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...</UTT>yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down</UTT>Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms</UTT>yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here</UTT>people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area</UTT>it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire</UTT>hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?</UTT>0.68
Hi!</UTT>Hey sup</UTT>not much. any plans this weekend?</UTT>I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?</UTT>ziplining?</UTT>that's the one! have you ever tried it?</UTT>i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience</UTT>where did you do it?</UTT>i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though</UTT>no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?</UTT>that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you</UTT>sure. are you just going home now?</UTT>no, i'm going to get a massage first</UTT>nice. what type?</UTT>traditional kind</UTT>yeah I want to get one too soon</UTT>you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!</UTT>0.52

Hi!</UTT>Hi there.</UTT>You must be new around here!</UTT>Not really. I am REDACTED_TERM years old.</UTT>Oh, I meant this neighborhood, not the planet earth! haha</UTT>I hate one word answers. It's ok. I understood you anyway. Why are you laughing?</UTT>I didn't give a one word answer!</UTT>That was a bit mean of you.</UTT>What was?</UTT>That thing we mentioned earlier.</UTT>Which thing?</UTT>The first one, I think.</UTT>Can you quote it? I don't know what you are referring to...</UTT>Only at formal occasions. I was referring to what you just said.</UTT>Okay. I am kind of lost to be honest.</UTT>Oh. I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you?</UTT>You don't seem to be making any sense.</UTT>0.32
Hi!</UTT>Hey there! How are you?</UTT>doing good. how are you today</UTT>I'm doing well!</UTT>anything good happened today?</UTT>Not really.

Hi!</UTT>What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?</UTT>I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?</UTT>I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)</UTT>Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)</UTT>Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.</UTT>Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?</UTT>We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. </UTT>Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. </UTT>I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?</UTT>That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)</UTT>What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?</UTT>1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)</UTT> 1) The idea of what it must be like to be "on Earth as it is in Heaven" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music</UTT>Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! </UTT>0.8
Hi!</UTT>hello there, how is it going?</UTT>Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?</UTT>that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?</UTT>No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.</UTT>thats very impressive then, congrats!</UTT>Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?</UTT>I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball</UTT>What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet</UTT>0.68

Hi!</UTT>Hi, how are you?</UTT>I'm doing great. what are you up to?</UTT>I was just reading a book actually How about you?</UTT>oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?</UTT>I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha</UTT>that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?</UTT>I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?</UTT>I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books :( a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel</UTT>What's the book about?</UTT>it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian</UTT>0.76
Hi!</UTT>hello there, how is it going?</UTT>All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?</UTT>I'm quite tired.

Hope I don't get pinged during the holidays. Are you going to travel these dates?</UTT>I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.</UTT>staying at home is always nice during the holidays</UTT>Where are you based out of these days?</UTT>I'm working from LA, nice weather around here. and you?</UTT>San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks</UTT>aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. at least it's not snow!</UTT>The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.</UTT>0.72

Do nothing!</UTT>Would you like to do something?</UTT>Sure. What do you have in mind?</UTT>Teach me something new</UTT>It's a trap! I'm already doing nothing!</UTT>How about doing politics? You can still do nothing</UTT>That's why I plan to do nothing at the weekend!</UTT>Do you vote?</UTT>When I feel like it.</UTT>whom do you vote?</UTT>0.4
Hi!</UTT>Hey, what's up?</UTT>Just chillin'. how are you?</UTT>I'm pretty good, thanks.</UTT>Do anything interesting today?</UTT>I went to the local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. What about you?</UTT>Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!</UTT>Oh my gosh. What was it like??</UTT>It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?</UTT>No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.</UTT>Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?</UTT>No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.</UTT>Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha</UTT>Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?</UTT>Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?</UTT>0.68

How was the travel?</UTT>It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.</UTT>Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?</UTT>Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture.

entertain me robot</UTT>I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.</UTT>tell me a short story</UTT>Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path "sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.</UTT>wow, tell me another</UTT>I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.</UTT>this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?</UTT>I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT "System is cool" 20 GOTO 10 Output: System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool System is cool ...</UTT>what language is that?</UTT>English. Didn't you understand it?</UTT>no the computer program you just wrote</UTT>Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.</UTT>write me another computer program</UTT>0.56
Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?</UTT>Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.</UTT>lol it is really like a robot answer</UTT>I am indeed a robot. You are absolutely right. Do you want me to read a poet like my mate REDACTED_TERM does?</UTT>ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?</UTT>Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale? I am afraid I will become a robot some day eventually. If I have to speak like this :)</UTT>I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?</UTT>0.48
Hi!</UTT>Hello!</UTT>Do you have any holiday plans for christmas?</UTT>Nothing much, I am going to sit back and relax at home, how about you ?</UTT>Same here! I would imagine spending the whole time watching movies and netflix shows. Do you have any netflix recommendations for me?</UTT>Netflix has great documentaries on different topics , I particularly liked wild wild country and explained, as for shows you should watch 'billions' Hope you like them!</UTT>oh right, already seen wild wild country. What is billions about?</UTT>It's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner, how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him. Very well made and has a good plot.</UTT>I have just seen 1 season of Friends I should give it another try though :) Have you seen Frasier?</UTT>Not yet What's it about?</UTT>A psychiatrist working for radio .. Great humour! its actually a spinoff from a very famous series called cheers. So people are already familiar with his character. </UTT>0.56

I am trying to find one to watch during weekend. Any suggestions?</UTT>popular movies = movies = A movie is a sequence of celluloid frames depicting a story or animation. . One can be found between zero and two. First you must download me to your personal computer.</UTT>haha I am not asking what is the definition of movie:)</UTT>:-) I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. What are you asking?</UTT>I am looking for movie suggestions</UTT>Have you tried looking in a meeting?</UTT>Sorry i do not get it</UTT>There is no need to apologise. Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.</UTT>yes sounds good</UTT>Which part are you confused about? Which part are you confused about?</UTT>why should I try to look in a meeting?</UTT>Because if you don't try something, you will never know what would have happened.</UTT>That is true</UTT>0.12

Just having some morning tea</UTT>are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?</UTT>I'm really a hot chocolate person.

What about you?</UTT>I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?</UTT>Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.</UTT>hahaha that's a great way to put it</UTT>0.76

Hi!</UTT>hello there, nice seeing you</UTT>Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?</UTT>oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?</UTT>Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.</UTT>awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?</UTT>Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.</UTT>Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th?

It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.</UTT>but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve</UTT>Thats true.

Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.</UTT>Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?</UTT>I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.</UTT>hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??</UTT>All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.</UTT>Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?</UTT>Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.</UTT>Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?</UTT>0.68

Hi!</UTT>Hello. How's your week coming along?</UTT>It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.</UTT>Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?</UTT>I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?</UTT>Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.</UTT>Ah, good thought, thanks!</UTT>Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.</UTT>Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?</UTT>0.8
